Have the QT bin folder on your path.

Open a command prompt.

navigate to the ‘project’ folder

run:  qmake

#################################
(NB :On older systems where OT was compiled with C++03 you need to uncomment

the line in project/common.pri

        QMAKE_CXXFLAGS += -std=c++03 -Dnullptr=NULL -DOT_USE_TR1  ## Ubuntu 12.04

and comment out the line

       #QMAKE_CXXFLAGS += -std=c++11

and also in project/moneychanger-qt/moneychanger-qt.pro uncomment the two lines

        # only need if no C++11 available (e.g. Ubuntu 12.04)
        LIBS += -lboost_system-mt
        LIBS += -lboost_thread-mt
)
##################################

then: make (-jx, where x is the number of threads you want).

navigate to the ‘lib’ directory.
where you will find moneychanger-qt
